Hello there!
Name's Vladyslav Savchyn.
This program is basically an implementation of A* algorithm.

You can run this program using gcc compiler:
gcc -std=C++17 -Wall a_star.hpp a_star.cpp main.cpp -o output.cpp

Or by clicking A_star_algo.vcproj file, to open everything using MS Visual Studio, and then by hitting F5.

Reminder: Don't forget to make your console text smaller, as everything will be dislayed at it.
