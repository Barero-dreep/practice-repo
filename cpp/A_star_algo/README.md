# Hello there!

My name's Vladyslav Savchyn.
This program is basically an implementation of the A* algorithm.

You can run this program using gcc compiler:
```
gcc -std=C++17 -Wall a_star.hpp a_star.cpp main.cpp -o output.cpp
```

Or by clicking A_star_algo.vcprojx file, open everything using MS Visual Studio, and then hit F5.

Reminder: Don't forget to make your console text smaller, as everything will be displayed at it.
